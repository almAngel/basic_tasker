# Basic Tasker

## What is Tasker?

Tasker is a tool to get, add, edit or delete your own tasks.
It has been made with Rust, and includes a basic terminal CLI to perform all of these operations, plus saving your data to a JSON file and loading the information back.

It's a performant, memory-safe tool just to glance the potential of Rust in making applications low-level enough to compete with C or C++.
